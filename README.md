# Hello, I'm Jedrzej ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing a double major in Quantitative Finance and Computer Science and Econometrics at the University of Warsaw, in my final year for both. My academic journey is a blend of finance, economics, and technology, fueling my passion for algorithmic trading, time series forecasting, and machine learning, with a special focus on reinforcement learning.

## About Me

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of finance and technology, especially the dynamic field of algorithmic trading. My main area of interest lies in reinforcement learning, where I've implemented a reinforcement agent that actively trades in the FOREX market. This project is a testament to my dedication and skill in navigating complex financial markets through advanced machine learning techniques.

Professionally, I'm navigating the intricate world of financial data as a Market Data Scientist/Data Engineer in the banking sector. My role involves harnessing vast amounts of data to uncover insights that drive strategic decisions, leveraging my programming skills in Python, SQL, R, and C++.

## Reach Out!

I'm always open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, finance professionals, and anyone curious about the potential of technology to transform traditional industries.

## My Projects

### Reinforcement Learning for Stock Market Trading

This is my flagship project where I've designed and implemented a reinforcement learning agent that autonomously trades in the FOREX market. By analyzing historical data and learning from market dynamics, the agent makes informed trading decisions, aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk. This project showcases my ability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world financial problems.

#### Technologies & Tools:
- **Languages:** Python
- **Key Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy
